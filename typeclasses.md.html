# Type classes

## Drawbacks of the current situation

- http://pchiusano.github.io/2018-02-13/typeclasses.html
- most glaring https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7xgkez/the_trouble_with_typeclasses/du89m1c/  
  - Dreaded diamond problem, how to discover such instances?  
    - Either make one package aware of the other
    - Or have some smart infrastructure suggest including stuff for instances
    - But then we could just include it altogether
    - And do this for every possible instance that isn't in the actual dependency set
    - Administrative overhead!
    - Couldn't we use backpack to specify which instances we want?

### Backpack-based solution

- https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7xgkez/the_trouble_with_typeclasses/dua1j9b/
- Would mean that the dependency solver must be aware of the module instantiations and compute the specific set of constraints just that particular instantiation
- Not a solution, but related idea: Inject type class instances into GHC's solver through some kind of Mixin process and have instances not be included by default  
  - Unsure what this solves. Instances must be declared in an unlayered Mega-repo nonetheless

### Real problem: Dependency footprint of unused instances

- When does this hurt?  
  - Binary size -- `-fsplit-objs` and maybe have GHC include better information on what is strippable?
  - Compile time -- We compile irrelevant stuff. Not really a problem when we have binary caching
  - Diamonds still -- No real solution to that. Take inspiration in expression problem?

#### Current solution: Packages of orphans

- Not really granular -- which packages should `vector-instances` depend on?
- [Bad discoverability](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7xgkez/the_trouble_with_typeclasses/du9mmu1/), although tooling could help (e.g. hoogle?)
- Related: [ezyang about confluence and coherence of type classes](http://blog.ezyang.com/2014/07/type-classes-confluence-coherence-global-uniqueness/)
- Orphans should be registered in GHC, so that it can find duplicate/incoherent orphans
