**Tutorial notes on partial evaluation**

# Introduction

- "Partial evaluation removes layers of interpretation"
- Interpreter = Program whose control-flow is determined by input data
- `printf` example: Specialise for format string

# Principles and Practics of PE

- Specialising function $\mathcal{S}$ specialises a program for static part of input
- Residual program = Residualisation = program specialised for some static input
- $\mathcal{S}$ is computable according to Kleene, resulting program is called a PE
- PE = unfolding+specialisation
- all input static => PE must include an interpreter
- all input dynamic => PE must include a compiler (or Id in source-to-source)
- performs constant prop, inlining (related to sparse conditional const prop)
- monovariant (single specialisation of a given function) vs. polyvariant (many specialisations)
- online (monolithic) vs. offline (staged) PEs  
  - online: non-standard interpreter => accurate, but high overhead
  - offline: preprocessing (binding-time analysis) + processing (specialisation) phase
- binding-time analysis (BTA): Which part of a program is static, which is dynamic?  
  - binding-time as in early or late bound, statically or dymanically bound
  - approximate
  - handle HOFs and data structures
  - polyvariant
- Shift interpretation of binding-times from processing to preprocessing, simpliying the specialiser (???)
- Combine online and offline => Online specialisation when binding-time property can't be determined  
  - Concrete values are available at specialisation time
- Has been formalised: binding-time analysis is abstraction of the online partial-evaluation semantics
- Specialising for some of its input = Given the value of some parameters, ...
- Can be generalised to projections for static and dynamic inputs

# "State of the Art"

- Fuse: online PE using graph IR  
  - From "Automatic Online Evaluation":  
    - "Fuse is designed primarily as an interpreter and secondarily as a program transformer. The specialised program is generated almost as an afterthought to interpretation."
    - Symbolic execution. Symbolic value have both a value and a code attribute
    - Major difference to interpreters in handling of if's and call's
    - Focus no longer on self-application (which is unviable?), target programs not written with specialisation in mind. so online makes sense?
- Bondorf, Similix: offline PE, self-applicable, fixed specilisation strategy
- Consel, Schism: Offline, polyvariant, HOFs, "flexible strategy"

# Termination

- Two sources in which specialisers might diverge: Unfolding calls indefinitely or unlimited number of specialisations (residualisations)
  - There are cases in practice where we want the fixed-point
  - Strategies:  
    - Programmer-supplied annotations (lame)
    - BTA for automatic annotations. Dynamic scrutinee, all procedure calls unfolded (?!)
    - Schism: Filters for each function, specifying under which conditions the call should be unfolded, which parameters calls should be specialised for. Can also be automatically generated

# Data vs. Code

- Space vs. time... Too many specialisations, too much space, yada

# Some Concrete Applications

## Pattern Matching

- Obtain KMP through specialisation of naive string matching for needle
- But resulting program is big; Shift table in data means being able to re-use the same code path. Impact?

## Microkernels

- Specialisation to regain performance of monolithic kernel
