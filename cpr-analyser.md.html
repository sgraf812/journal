# Thoughts about CprAnal

## Nested CPR

### Deriving higher-order CPR and termination

It makes sense to look at the strictness signature to figure out what gets
unboxed (CPR) and what we are strict in (term only). Hence we do so.

Q: Do we also need to look at idDemandInfo and forceCprTy in the Lam case?
A: We might, but it's optional: Apart from let-bound lams (which are
already handled by looking at the strictness signature), we can look at
idDemandInfo for anonymous lambdas. But only for termination info, since we
never WW these! And just using topCprType is conservative and probably won't
bite.

Now, there is another tension:
Q: When do we uphold our promise of forcing *arguments* according to strictness signature?
A: There are two options:

1. In the App case, we get to know the ArgStr which the app head puts on the
argument. These ultimately come from the CPR signature. But this requires us to
include ArgStr in the Cpr type, which is a bit weird. These will all be lazy
for data constrcutor apps, for example.
2. In cprTransform, where we see the idStrictness. It better matches with the
fact that the obligation to force is part of the CPR/strictness signature. Also
there is no need for ArgStr in the CPR type (only arity, possibly). It's also in
line with what DmdAnal does.

(Note that all this is only necessary for the termination analysis)

Q: What about unsaturated applications? Should `cprTransform` return `topCprType` or can we do better/simpler?
A: Just returning the unwrapped signature would work fine for CPR info. We
would just trim the signature to idArity in AnalBind, so we would not need a
special case if it was for CPR.
But not so much for termination! In an undersaturated application, we would
still force the incoming argument types and account for their termination,
which is wrong. Termination is only relevant when we have a saturated
application (to `idArity` arguments).

Ergo: `cprTranform` must only account termination in a saturated application.

Q: We need to forget CPR on incoming arguments flowing into *anonymous* lambdas (but not let-bound manifest ones). How do we do that?
A: We could do so in the App case; We already assume CPR according to StrictSig
for let-bound things and in all other cases we don't actually have CPR. EXCEPT
for DataCon transformers! What to do about them?????
On the other hand, there should never be a `App (Lam{}) _`, it would have been
eliminated by the simplifier. The case we are talking about will never happen!
Anonymous lambdas will never have an incoming CPR type. So don't sweat it.
