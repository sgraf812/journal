# Structural and semantic pattern matching analysis in Haskell

https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04160

Patterm match checking algorithm heavily inspired by GADTs Meet their Match
that uses an SMT solver to solve oracle constraints, apparently as a standalone
static analysis tool.

Also introduces *evaluatedness* of a function, basically computing
strictness/usage info from the pattern match, I guess.

## Introduction

All the same reasons as GADTMTM. Contributions are a static analysis tool that
uses an SMT solver for oracle constraints plus computing evaluatedness of a
function.

## Background

Some related work, including papers about pattern compilation (uninteresting
for Haskell) and Maranget's work on pattern match checking (which accounts for
laziness, but wrongly). Mentions
https://ndmitchell.com/downloads/paper-not_all_patterns_but_enough-25_sep_2008.pdf,
which also describes a static analysis tool that works for higher-order cases
(like `let (x:xs) = id [1]`). And finally GADTMTM.

## Algorithm

Mostly GADTMTM, but with some minor errors and ambiguities in presentation.

No negative constraints, so all the same difficulties with Con splitting
(efficiency, COMPLETE set selection).

I don't understand section 3.6 about evaluatedness. In fact, they are wrong
when they say that evaluating `fst (undefined, undefined)` will not diverge.
So it's all rather moot.

## Implementation

As a standalone tool using the GHC API. Performs minimal desugaring (for the
guards, like we do, apparently), but otherwise operates on the AST. Apparently
they don't "interface with GHC". So maybe they are using `haskell-src-exts` for
parsing? They don't properly support GADTs (and probably also data/type
families) due to the fact that they can't reuse GHC's constraint solver.

They represent integer literals by variable patterns and a guard.

The AST is finally brought into a representation understandable by an SMT solver.
Only some Haskell functions have a theory, like boolean and arithmetic expressions.

The constraint solver handles VarVar, VarBot and VarCore (basically)
equalities, where the latter must be Boolean expressions.
After some simplification, the boolean equalities are passed to an SMT solver
which determines satisfiability.

## Evaluation

Focusing on syntax only in a standalone tool, they get similar results as
GADTMTM (for non-GADT examples). For function with guards, there is an improvement.

(Note: I don't think it could handle cases where we mix pattern guards and
constructor pattern matches, because the necessary negative info is not
available to the constraint solver)

Counterexamples for guards are nice.

I think we can replicate most of the functionaitliy (`not`, linear arithmetic,
function application), very simple. Except maybe for linear arithmetic.

## (My) Conclusion

In general the approach seems to try to interpret certain expression constructs
in guards. In particular, it will *not* look into the definitions of functions,
so it can't interpret complete Haskell. At that point, it boils down to giving
certain functions a first-class treatment.

Many of the benefits can be achieved in our approach with a very simple extension
of the constraint solver:

- CSE will take care of function applications
- The constraint solver can be made aware of boolean logic (`not`, `||`, `&&`) rather cheaply
- The constraint solver can be made aware of linear arithmetic, probably at a higher price.

The last two points basically amount to an additional case in `addVarCoreCt`
for interpreted functions, just before the base case. We write our own simple
SMT solver, so to speak. Since I can't think of more theories than boolean
logic and linear arithmetic, this seems fine. Using an external SMT solver
seems like overkill, but maybe we can even allow it as an extension point?
