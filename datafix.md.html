# Thoughts about the `datafix` approach

## Comparison/Concepts from Datalog

- Uses declarative logic language like Prolog to specify analyses
- Faster (!) than C versions!
- Related: Dyna (implemented in Haskell), bddbddb, LogicBlox

### Practical program analysis using general purpose logic programming systemsâ€”a case study

- Applies this approach to strictness analysis
- Section 2: 'Analysis methods are usually described in terms of semantic equations whose fix point represents the program property under consideration. These semantic equations can be viewed as a (constraint) logic program, where each equation is translated into a Horn clause.'
- Section 2 is VERY interesting! Suggests that `TrasferFunction` is nothing else than a formulation of this logic system
- Section 3.2: Demand propagation (like transformer)
- predicate $sp_f(D, X)$ for function $f(x)$: incoming demand $D$ propagates to argument demand $X$ on $x$
- Performance in 4.3: 5% of time taken by ghc, although this was in 1996...

### From Datalog to flix: a declarative language for fixed points on lattices (2016)

- VERY VERY related
- Datalog dialect with proper lattices and ops
- DSL
- Rather slow, due to interpreter. FW: compile to JVM bytecode, query planning, index selection, etc.
- JVM, so not really usable
- Approach remarkable, mine droven to extreme
