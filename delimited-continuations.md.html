## shift/reset

In a nutshell, as a refresher:

```scheme
(+ 1 (reset (* 2 (shift k (k (k 4))))))
```

returns 17; is just the continuation between `reset` and `shift`, which is
called *twice* in the `shift`ed expression (which is evaluated before the
continuation, as per CbV). After evaluation of the expression, execution
continues outside of the reset, increments to 17.

The occurrence of `shift` marks the hole of the continuation's execution
context.
