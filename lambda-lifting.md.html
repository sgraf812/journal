# Lambda lifting: Transforming Programs into Recursive Equations

- http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.48.4346
- 3 Attempts:  
  1. Transform lets to lambdas + Y. Spoils known calls
  2. Don't transform lets: RHS are still PAPs to supercombinators
  3. Apply supercombinators at *call sites* to their free variables, don't retain bindings. Success!
- How to compute the arguments in one pass?  
  - Transitive closure over call/occurrence relationship, then merge free variables
  - $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$, but disregarding lexical scope, so not happening in practice
  - lexical scope (call relationship!) leads to a natural top-down algorithm

## Algorithm

1. Make all Ids unique
2. Give each lambda expression a fresh name
3. Traverse top-down. For each rec group, compute the set of variables to be abstracted out, as follows. What we know:  
   - $vars$ in scope, possibly occuring free in letrec.
   - $funs$: processed functions, for which we know its former free variables to be supplied at call sites
   - $sol$: Solutions for the function names in $funs$
4. Now  
   a) Set of equations $E_f = S_f \cup E_g \cup E_h ...$ (these are all variables needed at call sites) where  
      - $g, h, ...$ functions called by $f$
      - $S_f = vars \cap fvs(rhs) \cup E_{o_1} \cup ... \cup E_{o_n}$ unknown variables occuring int the body
      - $o_1, ..., o_n \in funs \cap fvs(rhs)$ any outer functions called -- we need their former free variables
   b) Solve
   c) descend with  
      - $vars := vars \cup \text{unfloated stuff, like thunks}$
      - $funs := func \cup \text{lifted bindigs}$
      - $sol := sol \cup {(f, E_f), ...}$ (add lifted bindings)
5. Perform substitutions  
   - At definition sites $f_i = e \Rightarrow f_i = \lambda x_1 ... x_m. e$
   - At occurrences $f_i \Rightarrow f_i x_1 ... x_m$
6. Lift out definitions to top-level

## Attribute grammar + impl

- LC with letrec
- makes use of lazy eval
