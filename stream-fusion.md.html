# Thoughts about Stream fusion

## Stream Fusion, to Completeness

- MSP: Like `Expression<T>` trees in .Net
- MetaOCaml   
  - Bracket `.<_>. : 'a -> 'a code`: Remember the unfolding of the expression. Analogue: `Expression<_>`, C# compiler rewrites syntax to expression tree
  - Escape `.~ : 'a code -> 'a`: Splice in/inline the rembered unfolding, into the current unfolding. Analogue: None, needs explicit build up of syntax tree
  - Run `.! : 'a code -> 'a`: (possibly JIT) Compile the unfolding and run it. Analogue: `expr.Compile()`
- Probably amounts to annotating `Stream` fields with 'force specialisation' annotations

## From Lists to Streams to Nothing at All

- Open problem: concatMap
- `[ i * i | i <- [1..n] ]` as `concatMap` of singletons
- We want the one of the mutually recursive functions ($go_2$) to be specialized to the `next` function  
  - These stepper functions are always used strictly by any possible `go` (is that so?!)
  - So we don't destroy any sharing when evaluating arguments to whnf before call to `go`
  - We can specialize `go` for the resulting lambda (whnf!), or at least let the inliner decide if to potentially duplicate code
  - That's a potentital drawback compared to specializing for data
  - Should probably employ the same/similar heuristics as the inliner to decide if specialization is worthwhile

## Solution: Call-pattern specialisation

- Doesn't currently work with lambdas
- Can be easily extended to work with lambdas, but doesn't cope with free vars (yet)
