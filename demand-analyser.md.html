# Thoughts about DmdAnal

## What does a `Demand` *mean*?

A `Demand` describes how (often and deep) a variable is evaluated.
It is meaningless to talk about a `Demand` in isolation; rather an expression
puts a `Demand` on one of its free variables (or arguments) when the expression
itself is evaluated to a certain depth, which described by a `SubDemand`.

Often, this sub-demand on the expression is implicitly assumed to be the Top of
the lattice, which means "evaluated to WHNF, but possibly deeper".

When a demand on `x` (which occurs free in some expression `e` which is put
under sub-demand Top) is of the form `[1,u]*sd`, that means it is safe to insert
a `seq`, thus ``x `seq` e``.


Both Usage and Strictness describe a property *over all traces* through an expression.

[[e sd_e]](x) = [l,u] :* sd

<=>

(Consider sd_e later. Seems appropriate to build a continuation/context from sd)
Let T be the set of all traces through `e` according to the collecting semantics.
Then `forall t∈T. l <= eval_x(t) <= u ∧ eval_x(t) > 0 => "t evaluates x deeply according to sd"`
